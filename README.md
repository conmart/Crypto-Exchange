# Crypto-Exchange

### What is it?

Inspired by the mobile investing app Robinhood, Crypto-Exchange simulates investing in the leading cryptocurrencies with real-time price information so you can get used to the markets before dropping some major cash on Bitcoin. Once you create an account you'll be provided with $20k of fun money to invest as you see fit and then sit back and watch as it grows or shrinks.
